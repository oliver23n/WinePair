When accessing the webpage, it displays a header with the title and a link to a modal for supported wine types, an accordion containing previously saved recipes parsed from the user's local storage, and an input field for the user to enter a wine type.

If the user inputs a wine type not supported and clicks the 'Go!' button, an alert is returned.

Upon inputting a supported wine type and clicking 'Go!', the user is shown a description of the wine, options to select dietary restrictions, and buttons for food recommendations.

Once a food recommendation is selected, as many as three cards are shown, each displaying the food title, a photo, link to the recipe, and a button to save the recipe in local storage.
